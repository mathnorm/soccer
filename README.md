# soccer

I have set up this repository to upload some of my personal projects in soccer analytics. I have posted two notebooks from a series I titled "Chasing the Game", which investigates
the change in tactics for teams in trailing and leading positions.

In the first notebook, I examine the impact of taking the lead or conceding on teams' scoring rates. In the second notebook I expand into a more spatially-oriented analysis
of pass distributions and structures for teams in trailing and leading positions relative to teams playing in a tied position.

I will be uploading my future work here as well as I continue exploring other questions in soccer analytics. If you happen to have any questions or suggestions for any of my
analyses please feel free to reach out as I'd love to discuss!

Thanks

MI
